        <h5>The Snake Oil craze </h5>
        <p>In the present day, the phrase snake oil salesman is often used to describe a scammer who knowingly sells
          fraudulent
          goods and tries to rip people off. In other words, a con man. And Clark Stanley is the man responsible for
          that. But
          here’s the plot twist: snake oil may have genuine medicinal properties.</p> <br>
        <p>You see, snake oil was introduced to America by Chinese immigrants who were brought in to build the
          railroads. After a
          hard day of backbreaking labor, they would share their homegrown remedies with the other workers to help ease
          the pain
          in their aching joints. Because back in China, oil obtained from Chinese water snakes had been used in
          traditional
          medicine for centuries in order to treat joint ailments such as arthritis.</p> <br>
        <p>And some modern day scientific studies have backed this up - analysis of traditional snake oil showed that it
          contained
          a very high percentage of omega-3 fatty acids, which help reduce cholesterol, inflammation, blood pressure,
          and can
          improve cognitive functions. In fact researchers in Japan found that mice fed with Chinese sea-snake oil
          showed a
          significant improvement in their ability to learn mazes and swim.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now don’t get me wrong, snake oil is certainly not some miracle medicine that’s going to make a lot of
          difference, but
          the point is snake oil didn’t start out as some fake medicine to get people’s money, it was simply passed
          around by
          people as something that was genuinely a little useful. So… why is snake oil nowadays associated with shady
          scams? Well,
          here’s the thing.</p>
        <img class="left" src="../assets success story/snakoil 1.jpg" alt="1">
        <p>Because some people did get benefits from this chinese snake oil, word of it spread like wildfire among the
          American
          working class, and soon all over the country there was huge demand for this chinese snake oil. There was just
          one
          problem, though. There obviously weren’t any Chinese water snakes in America, and there was no way that
          Chinese
          immigrants could import enough oil from back home to meet the ever-growing demand in the US.</p> <br>
        <p>And so, since demand for Chinese snake oil far outweighed the supply, this opened the floodgates for scammers
          to create
          their own version of snake oil - which of course they claimed was just as good - if not better - than the real
          thing.
          And this is where we meet our story’s intriguing protagonist, Clark Stanley.</p>

        <h5>The RattleSnake King</h5>

        <p>Clark Stanley, the self-proclaimed “Rattlesnake King”, said that he came from Texas.</p> <br>
        <p>Clark claimed that whilst working as a cowboy for over a decade, he’d spent a good chunk of the 1880s with
          the Hopi
          tribe in Arizona, and they liked him enough to entrust him with the secret knowledge of how to make their
          special snake
          oil medicine, which he then improved, to turn it into the most potent snake oil on the market. It was a good
          story - but
          it was just a story.</p> <br>
        <p>Nobody ever confirmed any of this, and there’s absolutely zero evidence of it. What’s more likely is that
          Clark had
          simply heard that there was a high demand in America for this chinese snake oil, and thus created his own fake
          version
          using rattlesnakes instead, which were much more readily available in America, and then created a backstory to
          make it
          sound good.</p> <br>
        <p>But despite having no medical evidence to back up his claims, Clark proudly told everyone he met that if you
          suffered
          from joint pain, or countless other ailments, then a bottle of Clark Stanley’s Snake Oil Liniment was
          guaranteed to
          soothe you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now at first, Clark was just another stereotypical small-time shady salesman. He’d travel all over the United
          States
          peddling his “miracle cure” one bottle at a time to the unsuspecting gullible masses. And whilst Clark was the
          first to
          truly capitalize on the snake oil craze, he certainly wasn’t the first person to sell useless concoctions
          disguised as
          medicines.</p> <br>
        <p>Before the creation of the United States Food and Drug Administration, there was no real regulation over the
          sale of
          medicine.</p> <br>
        <img class="right" src="../assets success story/snaakoil2.jpg" alt="2">
        <p>Anyone could sell their product and claim it had whatever medicinal properties they wanted, without fear of
          interference
          from the government. As a result, many entrepreneurs with no morals began creating something called patent
          medicines.
          These were typically advertised as treating a wide range of pains and illnesses, but conveniently they never
          actually
          revealed what all of the ingredients were.</p> <br>
        <p>It was always a secret formula. Which really just meant they could contain pretty much anything, and thus
          most of the
          time they were just a random mix of ingredients with little to no medical benefit. Whilst the patent medicine
          industry
          began in England in the 17th century, by the 1800’s they were being imported to many other countries.</p> <br>
        <p>And pretty soon scammers in the US realized that it would be much more profitable for them to just create
          their own
          tonics and elixirs, instead of importing them. So yet more of these patent medicines popped up.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, with so many different patent medicines being created in the 1800s, the market became crowded,
          because all of
          them made massive claims about the many different ailments they could treat. And so it became harder for these
          scammers
          to make their products stand out.</p> <br>
        <p>That’s why all of the most successful patent medicine sellers, including Clark Stanley and his snake oil, had
          one thing
          in common: their sales pitch was more of a theatrical performance. They’d enter a new town, set up shop on the
          main
          street, gather a crowd of onlookers, and put on a show to attract an audience and entice people to buy their
          products.</p> <br>
        <p>They’d make sure the whole thing was a spectacle, so it was essentially part carnival, part sales pitch. One
          of the most
          common tactics these patent medicine sellers used was to have fake plants in the crowds who vouched for the
          product from
          personal experience, and strongly encouraged others to try it for themselves.</p> <br>
        <p>Everyone else in the crowd just assumed they were genuine customers who loved the product, when really they
          were planted
          actors getting a cut of the sales money. And then once the show was finished and they’d sold lots of the fake
          medicine,
          they’d travel from town to town repeating the same con in a new place. Now, there were many people who did
          this - but
          it’s believed Clark Stanley carefully observed the tricks the most successful patent medicine sellers were
          using, and
          then decided to create an attention-grabbing show of his own. It was at the 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago that
        </p> <br>
        <p>Clark Stanley got his first big opportunity. Back then, this was the largest public event in the history of
          the United
          States, and Clark set up his own little stand at the fair where he would fascinate the public by manufacturing
          his
          special formula right there in front of them. Of course, he already knew the golden rule: put on a show.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So, Clark had brought with him a big bag of snakes. And he would snatch one from the sack, cut it open right
          in front of
          his gawking audience, and plunge it into boiling water. He then skimmed the fat off the top, mixed it with his
          own
          secret concoction of ingredients, and made his snake oil right then and there in front of the crowd.</p> <br>
        <p>It was an impressive show, and this over the top display of cutting the snakes right in front of the audience
          gathered a
          lot of attention, and thus Clark’s snake oil was immediately snapped up by the crowds who gathered to see his
          grisly
          performance. Whilst Clark’s theatrics helped him get a lot of initial customers, the other big breakthrough
          for Clark
          came when he used some of his profits to open a factory in Beverly, Massachusetts to produce his snake oil in
          larger
          quantities.</p> <br>
        <p>He began operating on a much grander scale than any of the other patent medicine sellers of the time, and
          this made his
          operation seem more authentic. By 1901, Clark had become the largest snake oil salesman in the country, and
          had one of
          the most popular products on the market - and so he opened an even bigger manufacturing plant.</p> <br>

        <p>In fact, his product had become so popular that Clark had to contend with knock-offs that purposely tried to
          imitate the
          look of his bottle. Clark warned everyone not to be taken in by such “worthless imitations” sold by shady
          traveling
          salesmen and street vendors. The irony of course is that this is exactly how Clark himself started out.</p>

        <br>
        <p>But as bizarre as it may seem, Clark had done such a good job of marketing his fake snake oil, that people
          were now
          making fake versions of his product. But despite the imitators, life was good for Clark Stanley, and his
          business was
          booming… at least it was as long as he didn’t have to actually prove any of these claims he was making.</p>


        <img class="left2" src="../assets success story/snakoil 3.jpg" alt="3">

        <h5>The Truth</h5>
        <p>At the start of the 20th century, the United States Government finally decided it was time to crack down on
          all these
          unchecked patent medicines.</p> <br>
        <p>They passed the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. This was designed to improve the quality of food and
          medications, as
          well as punish offenders who mislabeled their products or operated in unsanitary conditions. Although in
          reality, the
          act was mainly passed in response to public outrage over the appalling conditions found in Chicago’s
          meatpacking
          industry, and so that was the government’s first target.</p> <br>
        <p>This meant that even though dodgy patent medicines were rampant in the United States, it was not the
          government’s main
          priority, which allowed Clark even more time to keep selling his formula. It wasn’t until a decade later that
          the
          recently-formed FDA turned its attention to snake oil and the other patent medicines. Of course, it made
          perfect sense
          to start by testing the most popular product on the market - which was Clark Stanley’s Snake Oil Liniment.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now, it turns out that rattlesnake oil contains less than half the omega-3 that traditional Chinese water
          snake oil had,
          so despite Clark’s boasts and promises that his snake oil was the best that money could buy, it was never even
          close to
          the genuine chinese snake oil in terms of effectiveness. However, it gets much worse.</p> <br>
        <p>When the FDA tested Clark’s product in 1916, they found that there was not even any snake oil whatsoever in
          his
          medicine. It was mostly just mineral oil, mixed with 1 percent beef fat, some chili peppers, and a dash of
          camphor and
          turpentine to give it a distinct aroma. So basically, any health benefits people felt from Clark’s supposed
          “miracle
          cure” were likely the result of the placebo effect.</p> <br>
        <p>Some may say the ingredients which Clark added to give it the distinctive smell actually did incidentally
          have some
          minor health benefits, but what is clear is that Clark’s wild claims of everything his product could cure were
          not true
          at all. Now, if he’d been selling actual real chinese snake oil, then he’d have still been wildly exaggerating
          the
          benefits, but at least he’d have been selling what he claimed.</p> <br>
        <p>But the reality was his product didn’t even contain snake oil of any kind. And thus what most people don’t
          realize is
          that Clark Stanley wasn’t convicted for selling snake oil, he was convicted for selling fake snake oil. In the
          end, the
          whole thing was a blatant outright scam: claiming one thing, and selling another.</p>

        <br>
        <p>And using showmanship and lies to fool his customers. And thus, that is how the term snakeoil salesman was
          born, and of
          course, lives on long after Clark Stanley is gone. The worst part though, is that even though Clark had misled
          his
          customers for decades and made a fortune off his hopeful victims, he was only fined $20 for misbranding his
          product.</p>


        <br>
        <p>He was charged with “falsely and fraudulently representing it as a remedy for all pain.”, but even accounting
          for
          inflation, that’s only a fine of about $550 in today’s money. And thus, The Rattlesnake King evaded any severe
          repercussions for his actions and got to ride off into the sunset with his ill-gotten gains, thus literally
          and
          permanently giving snake oil salesmen a bad name.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now, Clark Stanley may have put on a good show to trick people, but he wasn’t as impressive as these guys
          right here.</p>
