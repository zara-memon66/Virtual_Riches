      <h1>How Chicken Tenders Made Him A Millionaire </h1>

    <main class="animated-content">
      <section class="success-story">
        <h5>The Beginning </h5>

        <p>After working in a variety of restaurants through highschool and college, Todd Graves had always had a dream
          of starting
          his own restaurant. And whilst he was at university, he took a business class where students were asked to
          come up with
          a business idea, and then make a business plan for it. </p> <br>
        <p>Todd was ecstatic about this, because it gave him the chance to properly plan out his restaurant idea, and
          have it
          evaluated by a professor. Todd teamed up with his best friend Craig for the project, and explained his idea.
          What if
          they created a restaurant that only did one thing, but did it the best? They could keep costs down by having
          the menu be
          as simple as possible, focusing on one easy dish, so there were no errors and it was always perfect.</p> <br>
        <p>Craig liked the idea as well, and since both Todd and Craig loved chicken fingers, they decided that would be
          the
          perfect product to go for. They both began pouring their time and energy into the planning of this chicken
          finger dream.
          Todd envisioned a place where people could come in, listen to good music, and eat good chicken.</p> <br>
        <p>A place where the workers enjoyed coming to work and genuinely cared about the business and wanted it to
          succeed. The
          dream was there, and after Todd and Craig spent many long days planning and writing out their model, and
          pricing up
          exactly what they would need, they excitedly turned in their final project to their professor. They’d worked
          so hard on
          it, and were sure they’d get an A.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, when they got the paper back, they’d got the lowest marks in the whole class. They were crushed, and
          Todd
          wanted answers. After class he confronted the professor and asked what was wrong with the idea to give it the
          lowest
          mark out of everyone. The professor said the idea was just too simple.</p> <br>
        <p>There was no way that a restaurant only serving one dish would be able to make it. Especially when they’d
          chosen chicken
          fingers which wasn’t very unique and had big competitors like KFC and Popeyes, who also offered other dishes
          as well.
          Todd and Craig, despite how confident they were in their concept and how deserving they felt of an A, were
          forced to
          accept the grade.</p> <br>
        <p>But this didn’t deter Todd. He wasn’t going to let some professor in a business class, or anyone else, tell
          him that his
          dream couldn’t be done. He vowed he would open his restaurant, and make it a success. So, Todd began to go to
          various
          banks, hoping to be able to take out a loan so he could get the funding required.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, every bank gave him the same response his professor had: it was a bad idea, wasn’t innovative
          enough, and
          wouldn’t work. Still, even after banks kept telling him no and rejecting his loan applications, Todd didn’t
          lose any
          determination; if anything it made him want to prove them wrong.</p> <br>
        <p>If the banks wouldn’t help him, then he would find another way to get the money</p> <img class="left"
          src="../assets success story/Chicken Tender2.jpg" alt="1">
        <h5>Funding</h5> <br>
        <p>To get the funds to start his restaurant, Todd began to apply to decent paying jobs all over the country.
          After a while,
          he was able to get a job as a boilermaker in southern California. The pay was good enough, so without a second
          thought
          Todd packed up his things and moved halfway across the country.</p> <br>
        <p>As a boilermaker, Todd’s job was to go around California and repair steam boilers, boiler furnaces, and
          boiler frames.
          The job was hard, and the hours long - as he worked about ninety hours a week, but Todd was saving money for
          his dream.
          Between and after shifts, he’d be too tired to do much else, and would stop at the fast food chain In-And-Out.
          There, he
          got to see an example of his idea in practice.</p> <br>
        <p>In-And-Out only served burgers, and not even a large variety of burgers, just a hamburger, cheeseburger, or a
          double.
          During his long days of fixing boilers, seeing In-And-Out’s success provided the motivation for Todd to keep
          working
          hard and saving money so he could reach his own fast food dreams.</p> <br>
        <p>However, even though Todd was saving every penny he could, he was a little frustrated at how long saving up
          was taking
          him. So after working as a boilermaker for a while, Todd found out about commercial salmon fishing in Alaska.
          The pay
          was amazing, but the job was incredibly dangerous and would require him to go way out onto the cold Pacific
          Ocean to get
          the Sockeye Salmon they were looking for.</p>
        <br>
        <p>He thought about it for sometime, weighing his options, but at the end of the day the pay was really good,
          and what’s a
          dream if you’re not willing to risk something for it? So, after moving to the dry scorching heat of southern
          California,
          Todd was now moving to the freezing lands of Alaska so he could work as a commercial fisherman. If he thought
          that being a boilermaker was hard, he was in for a rude awakening when he got onto his first fishing
          vessel. Between the ice cold salty water drenching him all hours of the day, the horribly chilling wind, and
          the twenty
          hour work days that were spent out in the ocean, Todd was out of his element.</p> <br>
        <p>However, any resentment he felt towards the job, or himself for taking it, evaporated when he saw that first
          paycheck.
          Alaska’s commercial salmon fishing industry makes an average profit of $230 million dollar a year, and
          although the work
          is brutal, they compensate their employees well. Todd could see his dream, which had once been on the distant
          horizon,
          suddenly jump much closer to him. He knew he just had to stick with the Alaska job a bit longer.</p> <br>
        <p>And thus, he continued to endure the harsh conditions, and continued to save up the majority of his
          paychecks. The banks
          might not help him start his restaurant, but sockeye salmon fishing would.</p> <img class="right"
          src="../assets success story/Chicken Tender 1.jpg" alt="2">
        <h5>The first Raising Cane's</h5> <br>
        <p>After working on the Alaskan fisheries for what felt like forever, Todd finally saved up enough money to move
          back to
          his home city,, and start his first restaurant. His dream was about to become a reality.</p> <br>
        <p>He bought a long since deserted bakery which had become a warehouse outside of Louisiana State University,
          figuring
          college students would love chicken fingers. The place was in shambles and had been deserted for ages, so Todd
          had his
          work cut out for him. He realized, with the state the building was in, it would cost a lot of money to hire
          people to do
          the renovations that needed to be done, which he hadn’t really budgeted for.</p> <br>
        <p>In the spirit of the rest of this whole journey, he decided he would simply do the renovations himself.
          Luckily for
          Todd, he had good friends who all agreed to help him build his restaurant. Craig, who was still in Louisiana,
          came out
          and helped him in this endeavor, and they spent long days at the warehouse tearing down walls and putting up
          new ones,
          ripping up floorboards, and installing all the necessary equipment for a restaurant to run - quite literally
          building
          Raising Cane’s by hand from the ground up.</p> <br>
        <p>And when removing the old plaster from walls, they actually found the original brick with the logo of the
          bakery this
          warehouse had once been. Todd decided to keep it, and it would serve as the inspiration for the design of the
          logo of
          his own restaurant… Which Todd still needed to come up with a name for.</p> <br>
        <p>He initially wanted to call it Sockeye’s Chicken Fingers, in memory of the fish he had spent so much time
          chasing around
          Alaska to get the funds to start this business. That idea, however, was quickly shot down by his friends who
          said it was
          a horrible name for a chicken finger place.</p> <br>
        <p>One friend pointed out that everyone would think he sold sockeye salmon, when in fact the absolute only thing
          on the
          menu was chicken fingers. Todd had to agree that he could see the issue of that name, but then what would he
          call it?
          Well, since removing back home, Todd had gotten a lovable golden retriever which he had named Raising Cane, as
          a play on
          words of the old saying “to raise cain,” which means to cause a ruckus.</p> <br>
        <p>His dog Raising Cane always came to the warehouse with Todd to do work and would run around keeping
          everyone’s spirits
          high. During the discussion on what to name the restaurant, one of Todd's friends suggested just naming the
          restaurant
          after the dog, which seemed like a better idea than Sockeye’s Chicken Fingers at least.</p> <br>
        <p>Todd loved the idea, and even took it a step further - What if he didn’t just name the restaurant after his
          beloved dog,
          but he made the dog the face of it? Raising Cane could be the mascot as well as the namesake. As he thought
          about it
          more, it just felt right. He was excited. And thus, his restaurant became known as Raising Cane’s. They were
          finally
          ready for business.
        </p>
        <h5>Business of Raising Cane's</h5> <br>
        <p>After much hard work and effort, the first Raising Cane’s opened in 1996 when Todd was just twenty-four. On
          their first
          day of opening, the community came out in a big way to show their support. The restaurant was packed all day,
          and more
          and more people were constantly spilling in to get chicken fingers.</p> <br>
        <p>They had opened their doors that morning, but with how busy it was weren’t able to close till 3:30 AM. After
          that first
          day, where Todd worked in any position he could from fry cook to cashier to manager, he took stock of his
          restaurant. He
          hoped this successful first day would be an omen for things to come. Given that their first location was close
          to his
          old university, he also wondered if his old business professor who’d rejected the idea had seen the huge
          demand.</p> <br>
        <p>Because, as planned, Todd had focused on just having one thing on his menu - one thing that he did the best -
          and that
          was the chicken fingers. He’d searched out the highest quality chicken for his chicken fingers, and then spent
          countless
          hours perfecting a secret sauce to go with them.</p> <br>
        <p>For sides, he incorporated coleslaw, crinkle-cut fries, and Texas toast. It was very simple, but exactly what
          he’d
          always hoped it would be. However, the full vision Todd had for his restaurant, of everything being very
          chilled and
          fun, would not be accomplished with the normal cut throat attitude of the restaurant industry. Todd had worked
          multiple
          jobs at restaurants himself growing up, and thus was very well aware of the amount of stress that often came
          with it, so
          Todd decided to take a different approach.</p> <br>
        <p>For example, staff were allowed to wear jeans and t-shirts if they wanted to and could play any music they
          felt like in
          the store. Todd also believed that putting the employees’ well being first would make the staff generally more
          joyful
          which would mean better customer service - and he wasn’t wrong; reviews started pouring in talking about the
          kindness of
          the people who worked there.</p> <br>
        <p>This idea that treating staff as a priority which would thus make customer service better and the employees
          better at
          their jobs was so successful that it became a quintessential part of what made Raising Cane’s unique and
          further
          elevated its reputation. Everything was finally coming together, and they were even able to get a small
          business
          association loan that would help them scale.</p> <br>
        <p>Todd smiled as he remembered a few years ago when the banks all rejected him saying his business would surely
          fail.
          Things were now looking up. Todd was CEO, but continued to work in the store at their first location, which he
          lovingly
          called “The Mothership.”, and appointed his friend Craig to be the co-CEO and help them expand. In Raising
          Cane’s first
          month of being open, they had a profit of thirty dollars - whilst that’s not much at all, Todd was over the
          moon about
          it.</p> <br>
        <p>That meant that he was able to pay the mortgage on the building, all his bills for the restaurant, and his
          employees’
          wages, and still have a very small amount of money left over. Most importantly, it showed this business model
          could
          actually work. Todd also had one more idea though… you see Bob Marley was one of his favourite musicians, and
          Todd and
          Craig had joked that chicken fingers was their one love. So Todd thought to himself, why not make the famous
          Bob Marley
          Song one love the slogan for Raising Cane’s? It was a lighthearted idea, but it ended up having serious
          consequences</p>
        <h5>Legal Trouble</h5> <img class="left2" src="../assets success story/Chicken Tende3.jpg" alt="3">
        <br>
        <p>By 2001, Raising Cane’s was using the slogan “One Love” to express their love for chicken fingers, and the
          fact they
          focused on just that one product.</p> <br>
        <p>By 2005, they officially trademarked it as they began to build more and more stores. In 2006, they won the
          National
          Restaurant Association’s Good Neighbor award for Todd’s projects in giving back to the community and his
          philanthropy,
          and in 2007 Raising Cane’s received “Best Place To Work” recognition in Chain Leader magazine.</p> <br>
        <p>Business was booming, and Todd couldn’t be any happier with the business, his staff, or the slogan that
          honored one of
          his favorite musicians. However, then disaster struck. After years of success and years using the slogan, in
          2013
          Raising Cane’s was sued by Fifty-Six Hope Road Music, a company that was founded by Marley’s heirs that
          controls the
          rights of the late reggae star’s photographs, music, and sayings.</p> <br>
        <p>Todd had been successfully able to get “One Love” trademarked for Raising Cane’s to use in certain
          circumstances, whilst
          Fifty-Six Hope Road Music got control of it in other circumstances due to their own trademark. And thus for
          many years,
          there had been no issue. And then one day, Todd got sued by Fifty-Six Hope Road Music. This was doubly
          troubling for
          Todd.</p> <br>
        <p>Not only was his business slogan at risk which they used in loads of their ads, it was quite distressing as
          an avid
          music lover and giant fan of Bob Marley, that he was being sued over this. The lawsuit started in December of
          2013, and
          Todd met constantly with Bob Marley’s daughter, for the better part of five months as they tried to reach some
          sort of
          agreement.</p> <br>
        <p>Finally, in May of 2014, they were able to reach a settlement that they both found mutually beneficial and
          allowed both
          of them to continue to use the phrase “One Love.” At the conclusion of the lawsuit, Todd was relieved to be
          able to put
          the legal troubles behind him and go back to expanding his restaurant.</p> <br>
        <p>Unfortunately, he would soon be facing a much bigger threat to his business</p>
        <h5>The Biggest challenge</h5> <br>
        <p>With Raising Cane’s ongoing success, Todd began to expand more and more all over the country. He continued to
          build
          stores all through Louisiana and the rest of The South, and expanded up to the Midwest as well, and eventually
          went out
          to southern California - this in particular gave him a lot of joy, as this was the state he’d lived and worked
          in when
          he started saving money for this dream of his, the state that housed In-And-Out, which had been his motivator,
          and now,</p> <br>
        <p>it finally had Raising Cane’s. Despite the lawsuit and the settlement, things were going good. Raising Cane’s
          eventually
          had the opportunity to expand to the Middle East, but before that happened Todd took time personally to change
          the
          recipe to make sure that all the products were up to standard for Islamic dietary restrictions, also known as
          Halal.</p> <br>
        <p>After tweaking the recipe to just make sure it was edible for everyone, the first Raising Cane’s opened in
          Kuwait, with
          soon more expanding all over the Middle East. For years, the business continued to do well. Those days of
          fishing in the
          cold of Alaska or working steam boilers in the heat of California seemed a very distant memory. It was now
          2020, and
          Raising Cane’s seemed in a position to keep growing to the top.</p> <br>
        <p>And then the event that devastated the restaurant industry as a whole happened; COVID-19 spread across the
          world,
          closing restaurant after restaurant down. Raising Cane’s was somewhat lucky, because they had drive-thrus
          which
          flourished during the pandemic, but they were still losing money.</p> <br>
        <p>Sales were down 30% and their whole business model involved making small margins on large volumes. Todd was
          beginning to
          worry that he was going to have to make some very hard decisions. Todd’s philosophy had always been to put his
          employees
          first, and was extremely reluctant to start closing down stores and forcing his employees to go out into the
          poor job
          market during the brunt of the pandemic.</p> <br>
        <p>So firstly, Todd made the decision he wouldn’t take a salary that year. Instead, he focused all his attention
          on making
          sure his employees stayed employed and trying to keep open as many stores as he could. Raising Cane’s changed
          their
          marketing to let customers know that restaurants were still able to serve food, firstly with their drive
          thru’s and then
          later with enhanced safety measures.</p> <br>
        <p>Some Raising Cane’s didn’t have drive-thrus though, and so Todd led the company to turn those locations into
          mask making
          facilities and paid his staff to make those masks to help prevent the spread of the virus. Todd took the
          pandemic very
          seriously and wanted to do everything in his power to make sure his staff and customers were both safe.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Due to all of his precautions, Raising Cane’s was eventually rated the number one fast casual dining
          restaurant for
          COVID-19 response and commitment to safety. And somehow, they managed to make it through without needing the
          layoffs and
          closures like many other businesses. Todd said: “I started this business from scratch. It’s a part of me. This
          is my
          family. I don’t want to leave anybody behind.</p> <br>
        <p>And so, to return to the original question of how Raising Cane’s has achieved success against all the odds -
          it seems
          clear that part of the reason has been Todd’s commitment to his employees and customers, and treating everyone
          fairly.
          Plus, despite many suggestions to change or add menu items, Todd has always kept the same menu and same
          recipe, building
          a reputation for quality and consistency.</p> <br>
        <p>Right from the start, Todd had a simple but clear vision of a restaurant that served high quality chicken
          fingers, in a
          fun relaxed atmosphere. And as Raising Cane’s expansion continues, it’s clear he’s most definitely succeeded.
