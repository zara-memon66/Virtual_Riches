                <h5>Who Was Katherine Johnson? </h5>
                <p>
                    Katherine Johnson was a brilliant mathematician who played a vital role in the early space program.
                    She
                    was born in West Virginia in 1918 and graduated from college at the age of 18. In 1952, she began
                    working as a "computer" at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which later
                    became
                    NASA. At NACA, Johnson performed complex calculations that helped to send astronauts into orbit and
                    to
                    the moon. She was also one of the first African Americans to work at NASA.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Johnson's work was essential to the success of the space program, but it was largely hidden from the
                    public for many years. This was due in part to the racism and sexism that was prevalent in the
                    United
                    States at the time. However, Johnson's story was finally brought to light in 2016 with the release
                    of
                    the book and film Hidden Figures.

                    Johnson received numerous awards for her work, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015.
                    She
                    passed away in 2020 at the age of 101.</p>

                <p>Katherine Johnson started teaching math and French in schools in Virginia and West Virginia in the
                    late
                    1930s. In 1952, she was accepted for a position as a computer at NACA's Langley Research Center in
                    Hampton, Virginia. Johnson was a curious and assertive employee, and she quickly earned the respect
                    of
                    her superiors. She was transferred from the African American computing pool to Langley's flight
                    research
                    division after only two weeks. Johnson achieved success despite difficulties at home, including the
                    death of her husband in 1956..</p>
                <br>
                <h5>NASA Pioneer</h5>
                <p>In 1958, after NACA was reformulated into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
                    Johnson was among the people charged with determining how to get a human into space and back. The
                    following year she remarried, to decorated Navy and Army officer James A. Johnson.

                    For Johnson, calculating space flight came down to the basics of geometry: "The early trajectory was
                    a
                    parabola, and it was easy to predict where it would be at any point," she said. "Early on, when they
                    said they wanted the capsule to come down at a certain place, they were trying to compute when it
                    should
                    start. I said, 'Let me do it. You tell me when you want it and where you want it to land, and I'll
                    do it
                    backwards and tell you when to take off .' " As a result, the task of plotting the path for Alan
                    Shepard's 1961 journey to space, the first in American history, fell on her shoulders.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The next challenge was to send a man in orbit around Earth. This involved far more difficult
                    calculations, to account for the gravitational pulls of celestial bodies, and by then NASA had begun
                    using electronic computers. Yet, the job wasn't considered complete until Johnson was summoned to
                    check
                    the work of the machines, providing the go-ahead to propel John Glenn into successful orbit in 1962.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>While the work of electronic computers took on increased importance at NASA, Johnson remained highly
                    valuable for her unwavering accuracy. She performed calculations for the historic 1969 Apollo 11
                    trip to
                    the moon, and the following year, when Apollo 13 experienced a malfunction in space, her
                    contributions
                    to contingency procedures helped ensure its safe return. Johnson continued to serve as a key asset
                    for
                    NASA, helping to develop its Space Shuttle program and Earth Resources Satellite, until her
                    retirement
                    in 1986.</p>

                <h5>'Hidden Figures'</h5>
                <p>Margot Lee Shetterly's 2016 book Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black
                    Women Who Helped Win the Space Race celebrated the little-known story of Johnson and her fellow
                    African
                    American computers. It was also turned into an Oscar-nominated feature film, Hidden Figures (2016),
                    starring actress Taraji P. Henson as Johnson..</p>
                <br>
                <b>Conclusion</b>
                <br>
                <p>Taylor Swift’s success can be attributed to a combination of factors, including her ability to
                    connect
                    with her audience, adapt and evolve as an artist, powerful stage presence, business acumen,
                    dedicated
                    fanbase, ability to tell a story through her music, philanthropy and activism. Her ability to
                    consistently deliver hit after hit, coupled with her genuine and relatable personality, have made
                    her
                    one of the biggest and most successful female artists of all time.</p>

                <h5>Awards and Legacy</h5>
                <p>
                    Johnson was honored with an array of awards for her groundbreaking work. Among them are the 1967
                    NASA
                    Lunar Orbiter Spacecraft and Operations team award, and the National Technical Association’s
                    designation
                    as its 1997 Mathematician of the Year. Additionally, she earned honorary degrees from SUNY
                    Farmingdale,
                    Maryland's Capitol College, Virginia's Old Dominion University and West Virginia University.

                    “We’re here to honor the legacy of one of the most admired and inspirational people ever associated
                    with
                    NASA,” Langley Director David Bowles said in a press release. “I can’t imagine a better tribute to
                    Mrs.
                    Johnson’s character and accomplishments than this building that will bear her name.”

                    Johnson's humble response to a building named after her was said with a laugh: “You want my honest
                    answer? I think they’re crazy.”

                    Her trailblazing contributions were celebrated at the dedication ceremony where Margot Lee
                    Shetterly,
                    the author of Hidden Figures and keynote speaker, said of the "human computers": “We are living in a
                    present that they willed into existence with their pencils, their slide rules, their mechanical
                    calculating machines — and, of course, their brilliant minds."

                    She said to Johnson: "Your work changed our history and your history has changed our future."

                    building named after her, Johnson simply said: “Like what you do and then you will do your best.”
