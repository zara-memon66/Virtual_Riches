      <h1>The shocking true story of Henry Ford</h1>

      <section class="success-story">

        <h5>A Miserable start</h5>
        <p> Born on July 30th, 1863, Henry Ford was raised on a farm in Dearborn, Michigan… which he quickly grew to
          dislike.
          Henry often avoided his daily responsibilities as the eldest son, spending most of the day at home, while his
          five
          younger siblings worked in the field. One neighbor even described Henry as: “the laziest boy on the face of
          the earth.”
          But there was a reason why Henry spent much of the day indoors; he had a complete fascination with machinery.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Going as far as to sharpen a pair of his mother’s knitting needles into screwdrivers, Henry spent as much
          time as he
          could conducting experiments around the house, like tinkering with clocks and farming equipment, trying to
          understand
          how they worked. But soon Henry started attending school and found it even more tedious than the farm</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          He thought it was a waste of time, and never made it past the 8th grade. Instead, Henry preferred to learn on
          his own.
          And as he got older, he enlisted siblings and friends to help build a variety of machines - from water wheels
          to
          miniature steam engines. Even though his projects often ended in a small explosion or even the occasional
          injury, it was
          clear Henry had a talent when it came to machinery.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Perhaps the greatest leap in his development came when his father gifted him a pocket watch at age 13. Henry
          quickly
          taught himself how to take it apart and put it back together again. He practiced doing this over and over,
          getting
          faster each time. And before long, he was getting paid to repair watches for people all around town.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>But just a few months later, Henry experienced a life changing moment. Traveling to Detroit with his father,
          Henry saw
          his first horseless vehicle. It was a tractor powered by a steam engine. And Henry was so captivated by the
          machine that
          he silently promised himself that he would make a vehicle like that of his own.</p>
        <img class="left" src="../assets success story/Henry Ford 1.jpg" alt="1">

        <br>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, that was also the year that tragedy struck. When he was only 13, Henry’s mother passed away due
          to
          childbirth complications. Henry was closer with her than anyone else in the world, and her death left him
          heartbroken.
          He described life on the farm without her as, “a watch without a mainspring.
          Henry then began to hate his rural life more than ever. He felt he was destined for greater things than
          milking cows and
          harvesting crops, but as the eldest son, his father expected him to eventually take ownership of their farm.
          This
          tension grew until Henry finally decided to leave home at the age of 16, abandoning the family business, and
          head to
          Detroit.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          This was a huge disappointment to his father, and put a big strain on their relationship. And things got even
          worse when
          just a week into his new job in Detroit, Henry got fired. Henry suddenly found himself alone in a new city
          without an income.But surprisingly, help would soon come from the last place he expected.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Trail and Error
        </h5>
        <p>Henry was rescued by his father, who landed him a repairman job at a machine shop run by a long-time friend
          of his.
          Though his father was disappointed with Henry for turning his back on the family business, he recognized
          Henry’s
          remarkable mechanical ability, and knew this work would be good for him. So Henry found cheap housing with his
          aunt, and
          took on additional night work as a jewelry repairman.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Between the two jobs he made $5.50 a week. And more importantly, Henry’s role as a repairman allowed him to
          experiment
          with a wide variety of machines. This time was essential in his development as a mechanic, essentially serving
          as the
          education he never had. But after nine months on the job, Henry decided that he’d learned all that he could,
          and moved
          back home.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And it was there, in 1882, that a neighbor came seeking Henry’s help to operate a newly purchased steam
          engine. Henry
          agreed immediately, despite the fact he’d never operated a steam engine in his life. He walked up to the
          shaking machine
          that was much larger than he was, calmly referring to it as “the little engine.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Henry fed the fire and adjusted the valves until suddenly the machine was up and running. The neighbor was so
          happy he
          offered Henry full-time work with a daily salary of $3. But word soon spread of this young man setting up and
          operating
          a steam engine despite no formal training, and at the end of the summer, a representative from Westinghouse (a
          company
          that manufactured these steam engines) came and offered Henry a job as a steam engine repairman.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Henry accepted, and spent the next several summers repairing engines across Michigan and Ohio. But Henry
          didn’t forget
          his dream. During the winters, he attempted to make his own steam-powered vehicle, just like the one he’d been
          so
          mesmerized by when he was younger. But despite countless hours of work, this was one thing Henry just couldn’t
          seem to
          do</p> <br>
        <p>Even though the first steam-powered vehicle was made in 1769, that engine and later versions operated on a
          track, and
          Henry was intent to make a vehicle which could drive on the road. But he realized that steam engines weighed
          far too
          much to be effective for quick, trackless vehicles. Thus, Henry was left with his dream, but seemingly no way
          to make it
          a reality.</p>

        <h5>The missing piece of the puzzel</h5>
        <br>
        <p>Flicking through a magazine, Henry Ford first came across an invention described as a “silent gas engine.”
          Henry
          actually dismissed the invention at first, considering it too weak to be a viable source of power. But a
          couple years
          later, a company asked him to repair such an engine. This experience completely changed Henry’s perception of
          gasoline
          combustion, as it produced far more energy than he’d anticipated, and the engine was much more lightweight.
        </p> <br>
        <p>Henry knew he had finally found a machine to power his horseless vehicle. He suggested to his fiance Clara
          that they
          move back to Detroit so that he could learn more about the gasoline engine. She agreed, which was lucky,
          because Henry
          had actually accepted a job in the city a week earlier, as a repairman with the Edison Illuminating Company.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
          Thomas Edison was one of Henry Ford’s heroes, and he felt this was the ideal place to work and learn. This
          role also
          gave him first hand experience working with gasoline engines. And Henry quickly impressed at the company, and
          soon
          worked his way up to becoming Chief Engineer, where his pay doubled to 80 dollars a week.
        </p> <br>
        <p>But best of all, since the position only required work on call, Henry had more time and freedom to work on
          his own
          creations - and in particular his horseless carriage concept which he now knew was possible with a gasoline
          engine. In
          fact, at a company retreat he finally got to meet Thomas Edison himself, who encouraged Henry to keep pursuing
          the idea.</p> <br>
        <p>And the two would later become close friends. To add to Henry’s good fortune, in 1888 he married Clara, and
          in 1893 they
          welcomed the birth of Edsel, Henry Ford’s only child. And it was that same year that Henry burst into the room
          on
          Christmas eve to tell his wife he’d finally made his first gasoline engine - admittedly at this point it was
          still very
          basic and only ran for a minute.
        </p> <br>
        <p>But all those years of tinkering had paid off. And now that he knew how to create the engine, he could focus
          on his
          dream of building his first horseless carriage. For the next 3 years, Henry worked tirelessly on the machine,
          using
          parts that would have been thrown out by the factory, like leftover tubing.
        </p> <br>
        <p>And by 1896, it was finally ready. Made up of two bicycles welded to a square chassis, it was dubbed the
          “Quadricycle.”
          The vehicle took its first drive early in the morning of June 4th, 1896 - and amazingly, the car drove quickly
          and
          reliably. Though other inventors had already created working gas-powered automobiles, Henry’s quadricycle was
          one of the
          fastest of its time, with a top speed of twenty miles per hour.</p> <br>
        <p>However Henry knew this was just the start. And so he sold his quadricycle for two hundred dollars, and used
          the money
          to begin working on the second model of his vehicle. This would take him 3 more years to complete, but when he
          was done
          he had a much improved version of his car. It was larger, faster, and ran more smoothly</p> <br>
        <p>At this point though, Henry was desperate to invent full time, but just didn’t have enough money to do so. He
          realized
          that he would need investors to pursue his passion, and so he set out to raise some money, ready to take the
          biggest
          risk of his career and start his own company</p>
        <img class="right" src="../assets success story/Henry Ford 2.jpg" alt="2">
        <h5>Failure & Racing</h5>
        <p>In 1899, Henry had the chance to drive a very wealthy lumber salesman on a three and a half mile drive.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By the end of the ride, the salesman was so enthralled by Henry’s car that he immediately agreed to invest in
          Henry’s
          new company. By showing off his car like this, Henry managed to acquire a total of 12 investors and a capital
          of 15,000
          dollars. And thus, the Detroit Automotive Company was founded in August 1899, with Henry placed as the chief
          engineer.
        </p> <br>
        <p>By this point though, there were many other brands of horseless carriages. All of them were handmade and
          extremely
          expensive, and because of this, cars only served the function as luxury items for the rich. Whereas Henry’s
          goal was to
          craft efficient, well made vehicles that were affordable for the masses.</p> <br>
        <p>Unfortunately this was not what his shareholders wanted. The investors demanded a variety of different
          vehicles built as
          quickly as possible to sell for a premium price to wealthy hobbyists, regardless of build quality or
          reliability. Henry
          was in constant conflict with shareholders as they grew furious with the constant production delays.</p> <br>
        <p>They pressed for higher profits, whilst Henry pressed for perfection. Although Henry had mastered how to
          build an
          automobile, he had definitely not mastered the business side of things. His experience was in crafting
          vehicles one at a
          time, putting a lot of care into each one - but shareholders pushed him to churn out cars at a quality he
          wasn’t happy
          with, and at prices he didn’t feel were justified.</p> <br>
        <p>And it turns out the public agreed with him.The vehicles were simply too much for poor quality. As a result,
          the company
          wasn’t profitable, and continued to have issues and delays. So within only 2 years of its grand opening, the
          Detroit
          Automobile Company was dissolved in 1901. Despite the failure of the Detroit Automobile Company, Henry still
          had well
          connected friends in the city - some of which owned a warehouse where they allowed Henry to continue to work
          on his
          inventions.</p> <br>
        <p>Although his first business hadn’t worked out, Henry at least now had more freedom to focus on what he
          actually wanted,
          and at this point, he wanted to make his own race car, as that would allow him to work on a singular car for a
          long
          period of time. And it turns out, Henry had an idea. Henry felt that other racers of the time were far too
          focused on
          power, when actually he felt a car would be much more successful by making it lighter.</p> <br>
        <p>And thus Henry began work on a very lightweight 26-horsepower, 2-cylinder racer. This philosophy won Henry
          his first
          race in a 10-lap competition at the Detroit Driving Club. Following the fame Henry gained from winning several
          more
          races with his lightweight racer, many of the same shareholders from the failed Detroit Automobile Company got
          back in
          touch with Henr</p> <br>
        <p>They basically agreed that given Henry’s recent success in the racing world, maybe they should try again to
          set up a
          company producing cars together, and thus the Henry Ford Company was founded. The goal of this company was to
          produce
          lightweight city cars. However, Henry’s recent victory in racing had made him obsessed.</p> <br>
        <p>All he wanted to do was build race cars, and to figure out how to make them go as fast as possible. So just
          like with
          their first company, Henry was constantly at odds with the shareholders. Because instead of focusing on
          producing
          passenger cars and focusing on profits, Henry fixated on the mechanical ability of individual race cars, once
          more
          chasing perfection.</p> <br>
        <p>Investors were again extremely frustrated, and eventually replaced Henry Ford as chief engineer. Thus, Henry
          Ford left
          the Henry Ford Company, signing a contract that gave him the rights of his name back, nine hundred dollars,
          and the
          designs for the four cylinder racer he had been working on. With Henry’s sudden departure, they obviously
          needed a new
          name, so they reorganized the business as the Cadillac Automobile Company, which went on to find great
          commercial
          success.</p> <br>
        <p>Meanwhile Henry Ford was once again now out on his own, and with two business failures under his belt
          already. But of
          course, Henry wasn’t going to give up that easily. He returned to racing, and in 1901 created the
          groundbreaking Ford
          999, a car that swept the competition. Two years later, the next iteration of this car broke all American
          driving
          records, with a top speed of 56 miles per hour.</p> <br>
        <p>All of this success in the racing world catapulted Henry Ford’s reputation to new heights, which once again
          attracted
          the attention of a lot of investors who wanted to work with him. Surely there was some way to turn Henry’s
          inventions
          and innovative mind into a very profitable company? And this is what led to Henry starting his third and final
          business
          venture in 1903: the Ford Motor Company.</p>

        <img class="left2" src="../assets success story/Henry Ford 2.jpg" alt="3">

        <h5>Mass Production</h5>
        <p>Whilst cars still remained a luxury item for the rich, Henry had always wanted to change that. He declared “I
          will build
          a motor car for the great multitude.” His new company’s first product was a two-cylinder, eight-horsepower
          passenger car
          known as the Model A. Their first car sold for $750, a week before Henry’s 40th birthday.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Whilst it was a reasonable start, these first cars were made at a factory in Mack Avenue Detroit, with
          several workers
          building two or three cars each day entirely by hand. And so it was still a very slow process. However,
          everything
          changed when Henry Ford visited a slaughterhouse in Chicago. It was there that Henry had an idea that would
          change
          everything.
        </p> <br>
        <p>Henry observed as the cow carcasses moved along an automatic conveyor belt while each worker performed one
          specific task
          to prepare it for consumption. Like cogs in a machine, the workers were unbelievably quick and efficient.
          Henry decided
          to adopt the innovation of the assembly line for his own car factories, splitting the production process into
          a series
          of small individual tasks.
        </p> <br>
        <p>He’d then assign workers to one task each which they could complete quickly, over and over again, with no
          skill or
          experience required. Immediately factory efficiency increased by 500 percent, and Henry was able to quickly
          expand and
          hire 300 new employees, since he could hire cheap low skilled labor to do these repetitive tasks.
        </p> <br>
        <p>Henry then took his radical practices one step further. Knowing from personal experience how a single missing
          part could
          delay car production for weeks, he began to implement the manufacturing of individual car parts in his
          factories, making
          everything from engines to transmissions. This sped up production time even more.
        </p> <br>
        <p>And whereas it had initially taken Henry two and a half days to build a single car, it now took only 90
          minutes. This
          extreme progress set the stage for him to launch the Model T, which would go on to be one of the most
          successful cars in
          history, Thanks to all the improvements Henry had made to the production process, he was finally able to
          produce a car
          for the average person.
        </p> <br>
        <p>There were three ideas he wanted for this car; for it to be affordable, durable, and easy to operate, and
          that’s exactly
          what he did. Every Model T rolled out of the factory with the same interchangeable parts and the same shade of
          black
          paint, coming with a detailed instruction manual so the owners could understand and fix the vehicles
          themselves.
        </p> <br>
        <p>It was an immediate best seller, bringing in huge profits for the company, and allowing them to ramp up
          production even
          further. By 1914, Henry was selling more cars than all other car manufacturers in America combined. Before
          long, every
          other car on the road was a Ford. And surprisingly, as Model T’s flew out of dealerships, Henry steadily
          decreased the
          price of his car.</p> <br>
        <p>Whilst this went against what most companies would do, Henry knew if he lowered the price further he could
          get even more
          people to buy his car, and ensure it remained the most popular choice. And sure enough before the end of its
          production,
          over 15 million Model Ts would be sold. However, Henry Ford had a huge problem.</p> <br>
        <p>Many of his workers had become extremely disappointed in their new jobs, having gone from assembling entire
          cars by hand
          to completing the same monotonous task day in and day out. All the skill and craftsmanship seemed to have been
          taken
          away with this assembly line style production. Many workers quit, and the Ford Motor Company faced an
          extremely high
          turnover rate of 380 percent, a problem which could easily lead to the end of the company.</p>

        <h5>The modern work week</h5>
        <br>
        <p>Henry Ford did something extreme. He doubled the pay of his workers, from $2.50 to $5 a day. Which back then
          was
          considered a very good wage, much higher than what other companies paid. Not just that, since a large number
          of the
          workers were immigrants, Henry provided free English lessons so that they could communicate better on the
          factory floor.</p> <br>
        <p>He also reduced their working hours from 9 to 8 hours, and introduced the 5-day work week, giving his
          employees the
          weekend off - whereas up until this point most workers only got Sundays off. These changes went completely
          against the
          norms of the time, and Henry faced a familiar problem: his shareholders were outraged.</p> <br>
        <p>They felt as if money was being stolen out of their pockets and given to workers for no reason. Henry tried
          to explain
          his theory that allowing workers to have more rest would inspire them to work harder when they were on the
          job. He also
          explained the higher wage would attract more workers. And sure enough, workers across the country soon flocked
          to the
          Ford factories of Detroit, causing an economic boom for the city and forcing competitors to enact similar
          policies
          because they were losing their employees to Ford.</p> <br>
        <p>Plus Henry’s decision to decrease work time by one hour allowed Henry to add a third, 8-hour shift to the
          schedule. With
          three 8-hour shifts, the factory could run 24 hours a day, staying open at all times. And thus, whilst Henry’s
          changes
          seemed surprising at the time, they all made a lot of sense. And it's partially thanks to Henry Ford that most
          modern
          businesses today use the model of the eight hour work day and five day work week.</p> <br>
        <p>However, at the time the shareholders didn’t see these changes as progress. They ordered Henry to stop
          increasing wages,
          and when he refused, they took him to court and claimed that he was intentionally costing them money and
          breaching his
          duties to shareholders. Henry felt like his business was being taken away from him.</p> <br>
        <p>He’d worked so hard to build it up from nothing, and whilst he was finally seeing success, once again his
          clashes with
          shareholders were putting it all at risk. He couldn’t start over again. Henry knew he needed to seize control
          of the
          company as quickly as possible. So, in 1906, using his own personal savings, Henry bought enough of the
          company’s stock
          to bring his ownership interest up to 51%, making him the majority owner – and the controlling shareholder.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>He’d put basically all his money into the company, but he was betting on himself.</p>

        <h5>An Iron Fist</h5>
        <p>In 1919, Henry handed over leadership to his son Edsel, naming him president of the Ford Motor Company.
          However, Henry
          still ruled behind the scenes with an iron fist, and was the one still making the big decisions. For example,
          Edsel
          urged his father to modernize the company, and he would come into the office each day with new plans and
          proposals.</p> <br>
        <p>But Henry was extremely harsh on his son, and often responded with a barrage of shouts and insults, refusing
          to produce
          any new cars Edsel suggested, because Henry claimed that the Model T was all that customers wanted. Not only
          did Henry
          refuse his son’s ideas, he ordered members of upper management to send Edsel on week-long meetings across the
          country to
          keep him out of the office.</p> <br>
        <p>But it turns out, Edsel may have been onto something. Because year after year, sales of the Model T
          decreased. A half
          decade of prosperity in America and cheap credit resulted in a public demand for stylized, more luxurious
          cars, which
          competitors like General Motors and Chrysler were happy to provide. And so finally in 1927, Henry could no
          longer
          disagree with the diminishing number of sales, and consented to building a new vehicle.</p> <br>
        <p>Ford created a new version of the Model A catered to the modern demands of the industry. It boasted the first
          commercial
          V8 engine and was offered in four different colours. However, by the time the Ford Motor Company could start
          selling
          their new Model A, they had already fallen to third place among the car manufacturers in the United States,
          behind
          Chrysler and General Motors.</p> <br>
        <p>And soon after, the Great Depression hit, forcing Ford to lay off many workers and lower the high wages that
          the company
          had been known for, While he still claimed to be a man of the people, Henry ended up hiring a secret police
          force to spy
          on his employees when he heard some were attempting to unionize.</p> <br>
        <p>Henry even employed people in his factory to root out union organizers and have them beaten. When workers
          protested,
          Henry ordered police to quell them and attack the protesting workers with tear gas, and even gunfire.
          Tragically, this
          resulted in the death of 4 workers in what was known as the Ford massacre.</p> <br>
        <p>And things would soon get even more controversial</p>


        <h5>Henry Ford's weird jungle town </h5>
        <p>In the late 1920s, Henry bought up millions of acres of land in Brazil, in one of the wildest places on
          Earth. You see,
          the synthetic rubber market didn't really exist back then, but rubber was needed in large quantities for the
          vast amount
          of cars Ford was now mass producing.</p> <br>
        <p>And so in an attempt to build a reliable source of rubber, Henry set-up a rubber plantation in the Brazilian
          jungle so
          they could farm rubber trees. The plan was to harvest the rubber and ship it back to Detroit, where it would
          be turned
          into tires and other parts for Ford cars. But rubber wasn’t the only goal.</p> <br>
        <p>Henry Ford also wanted to create a utopia modeled after the rural America he grew up in. Essentially, he
          wanted to build
          a self-sufficient town in the heart of the jungle where all the workers on his rubber plantation would live.
          He called
          it Fordlandia, and it had homes, shops, a school, a hospital, a golf course and of course a processing plant
          for all
          that rubber.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In total, it housed over 7,000 individuals. However, Henry wanted the town to operate under a very strict and
          controversial set of rules which were enforced by the American managers. Alcohol, tobacco, and playing sports
          were all
          banned within the community, even in the residents’ own homes, and there was a police force to ensure all the
          rules were
          enforced.</p> <br>
        <p>Plus, Fordlandia soon began to face a lot of challenges; adverse weather, disease outbreaks, anger amongst
          the workers,
          and environmental calamities. All of this signaled that the venture was heading towards failure. And yet
          despite this.
          Henry continued to invest millions into the project, until finally a disease crippled the town’s workforce and
          its
          rubber production.
          23:07</p> <br>
        <p>Discontent among workers eventually led to an open revolt, and Henry had to accept Fordlandia was a very
          expensive
          mistake. Henry had to sell the plantation to the Brazilian government for only $250,000—a fraction of his
          total
          investment. And the deserted ruins of Fordlandia still remain as a symbol of Henry Ford's wild jungle utopia
          idea.</p>


        <img class="right" src="../assets success story/Henry Ford 3.jpg" alt="3">

        <h5>Ford & Nazism</h5>

        <p>As Henry Ford grew older, he became more and more obsessed with Jewish people, blaming them for almost
          everything he
          didn’t like. A close friend quoted Henry saying “The Jew caused the war, the Jew caused the outbreak of
          thievery and
          robbery in the country, the Jew even caused insufficiencies in the navy.</p> <br>
        <p>Henry would go on to fund a newspaper that published anti-semitic articles to spread his hatred to the
          masses. He even
          published a weekly segment entitled, “The International Jew: The World’s Problem.” Due to aggressive sales
          strategies,
          the paper got 700,000 weekly readers at its peak. And Henry would publish over sixty articles attacking Jews,
          later
          compiling them into four books, one of which the Nazis would cite as an inspiration to the Nazi party.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Even Adolf Hitler himself said that Henry Ford was a great personal inspiration to him, and he claimed to
          have a life
          sized portrait of Henry Ford in his office. Hitler also distributed Henry Ford’s books and articles throughout
          Germany,
          and mentioned Henry Ford by name in Mein Kampf. Then, in 1938, the Nazi party awarded him the Grand Cross of
          the German
          Eagle, the highest medal that could be given to foreigners, and Henry Ford gladly accepted.</p> <br>
        <p>He was given the medal for his “ideals” and devotion” to the same cause as the Nazi party. And Henry Ford’s
          relationship
          with Nazism went even deeper. A U.S army report in 1945 stated that the German branch of the Ford Motor
          Company, still
          under Henry Ford’s control, “served as an arsenal of Nazism” during the war.</p> <br>
        <p>While most American companies pulled their stores from Germany at the start of World War II, Ford continued
          using German
          plants. Reports from American G.I’s commented how strange it was to see the Germans, America's enemies,
          driving Ford
          automobiles into battle. It’s even reported that Ford utilized slave labor from concentration camps to produce
          cars and
          trucks for the Nazis.</p> <br>
        <p>What’s clear is that Henry Ford was not just anti-semetic, he was incredibly influential in spreading
          anti-semistim all
          around the world.</p>
        <h5>Legacy</h5>
        <br>
        <p>In 1943, Henry’s son Edsel died from stomach cancer, having never truly seen his vision realized within the
          Ford Motor
          Company, given Henry was the one still calling all the shots.</p> <br>
        <p>In fact, Henry Ford’s grandson has claimed that Henry Ford “berated” Edsel to death, as he felt Henry had
          caused him so
          much unnecessary stress and hardship that it had made him ill. Within a few years of his son dying, Henry Ford
          himself
          died in 1947, at 83 years of age. The Ford Motor Company was left reeling from the loss of their leader
          without a clear
          path forward.</p> <br>
        <p>Ultimately, it was Henry Ford’s grandson who took control of the company, until 1979. But whereas Henry Ford
          single-handedly led the company for 39 years, The Ford Motor Company would change CEOs 13 times over the
          course of the
          next 41 years. Regardless of the changing leadership though, the automotive giant continued to find commercial
          success
          building on the foundations Henry had laid, producing bestselling cars like the Thunderbird, Mustang, and
          countless more
          classics.</p> <br>
        <p>However, it would never dominate the industry as it once had under its original leader. Of course Henry Ford
          would
          remain a divisive part of Ford’s history. On the one hand he was a genius, an innovator - he pioneered
          assembly line
          production, and in many ways improved conditions for workers. But on the other hand, he was brutal towards
          unions, was
          racist, anti-semtiic, and actively spread his hatred and caused a lot of damage.</p> <br>
        <p>In response to this, in 2001, the Ford Motor Company agreed to a 5 billion dollar settlement, providing
          reparations for
          using Jewish slave labor in concentration camps to build factory materials. In more recent times, The Ford
          Motor Company
          has turned its focus to fuel-efficient vehicles and electric hybrids.</p> <br>
        <p>In July 2023, the U.S Department of Energy announced that it would be giving Ford a 9.2 Billion dollar loan
          to build
          completely Electric Vehicles - the largest loan in the history of the Auto Industry. Valued at over 50 billion
          dollars
          today, and ranking as one of the 10 largest car companies in the world, it’s easy to forget that The Ford
          Motor company
          started with a single farm boy and his desire to create a new kind of machine.</p> <br>
        <p>Whilst Henry Ford remains a controversial and complex figure, there’s no doubt that he changed the world, and
          the way we
          do business.</p>
