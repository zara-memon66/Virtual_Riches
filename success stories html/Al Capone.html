                <h5>Al Capone </h5>
                <p>Al Capone is America’s most infamous mobster. He is known for his involvement with the Chicago
                    organized
                    crime syndicate, where he ruled during prohibition.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Al Capone was a mobster who worked with the Outfit syndicate of the Italian-American mafia during the
                    Prohibition era. Capone was infamous for his conglomerate of illegal business ventures and for being
                    one
                    of the most brutal mob bosses the country has ever seen. He elevated Chicago as the hub for mafia
                    activity during the 1920s and ruled with an iron fist. His fortune was massive, and his network of
                    mobsters extended far and wide. Capone was a typical “gentleman mobster” who always used a middleman
                    and
                    was always in the right place at the right time. This is the story of his life, conviction, death,
                    and
                    legacy.</p>
                <br>

                <h5>The Beginning of Al Capone</h5>
                <p>Alphonse Gabriel Capone was born in Brooklyn, New York, on January 17, 1899. His parents were Italian
                    immigrants who arrived in the United States in 1893. His father, Gabriele, was a barber and his
                    mother,
                    Teresa, was a seamstress. When the Capones arrived in New York, they already had two small children,
                    and
                    Teresa was pregnant with their third. In all, Capone had eight siblings: six brothers and two
                    sisters.
                    Two of Capone’s brothers, Ralph “Bottles” Capone and Salvatore “Frank” Capone, would go on to work
                    with
                    him in some way, through direct involvement with the mob or by helping with his bootlegging
                    business..
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>Capone attended a parochial Catholic school, and while he was a good student, he struggled with the
                    strict rules. He was expelled at 14 for hitting one of his female teachers in the face. He then
                    worked
                    odd jobs around the city and played semi-professional baseball. By the time Capone was 14 years old,
                    he
                    had met Johnny Torrio, a New York City gangster whom he would consider a mentor. Torrio sought to
                    transform the business of organized crime from being a grisly and violent culture to a corporate
                    one.
                    Torrio introduced Capone to the crime world, and eventually, Capone and Torrio were working with
                    some of
                    the most significant gangs in New York.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Al Capone began working with different street gangs in 1918. He was involved with the Junior Forty
                    Thieves, the Bowery Boys, the Brooklyn Rippers, and the Five Points Gang. He was employed by a
                    racketeer
                    named Frankie Yale, who mentored Capone at his bar in Coney Island called the Harvard Inn. During
                    this
                    time, a man slashed Capone in the face after inadvertently insulting his sister. This injury gave
                    him
                    the nickname “Scarface,” which he would be known by for the rest of his life. Capone hated it
                    despite
                    being known by the name and actively tried to hide his scar in all photographs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 1918, Capone married Mae Coughlin, an Irish-American Catholic, two years his senior. However, Mae
                    and
                    Al both listed their ages as 20 on their marriage certificate. The couple’s first and only child,
                    Albert
                    Francis “Sonny” Capone, was born three weeks before their wedding. Al settled down for a while,
                    becoming
                    a bookkeeper. However, after his father’s sudden death, Al returned to working with the mob. Mae was
                    never involved with her husband’s crimes and actively discouraged their son from becoming involved
                </p>

                <h5>Becoming the Boss</h5>
                <p>The Capones moved to Chicago in 1919 at the behest of Joe Torrio, who was working as an enforcer for
                    James “Big Jim” Colosimo, an essential boss in the Italian American organized crime syndicate. After
                    Colosimo’s murder in 1920, Torrio took over as the boss of the largest organized crime group in the
                    city. Whereas Colosimo reportedly refused ever to be involved with the bootlegging business, Torrio
                    began involving his group in the operations of the illegal alcohol industry soon after his ascension
                    to
                    the highest seat. He attempted to be known for his settling of disputes, but he misstepped in this
                    role
                    when he ordered the hit of the rival North Side group’s leader. The successors of the North Side
                    group,
                    including Bugs Moran, were eager to enact revenge on the Italian group.</p>
                <br>


                <p>In 1925, Torrio was shot multiple times on his way home from an outing. He survived but, after
                    recovering, retired from his role as boss of the group, which had now become known as The Outfit.
                    Torrio
                    handed the reins to Capone, who dove headfirst into the role. Capone was head of an organization
                    that
                    ran illegal breweries, gambling rackets, and prostitution rings, all with the protection of
                    political
                    and law enforcement allies.</p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    This protection was only furthered when The Outfit moved their headquarters to Cicero, Illinois,
                    where
                    Capone and several of his men, including his brothers, intimidated and bribed their way into public
                    office. They were able to set up many more racketeering businesses, as they were the law now. This
                    takeover made it harder for the North Side Gang to eliminate members of Capone’s Outfit, but it did
                    not
                    stop it. Several attempted and successful hits were carried out when he lived in Chicago. Capone
                    never
                    went anywhere without an armed detail, although he never carried a weapon himself.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Capone sought to retain an image of himself as a respectable businessman and a contributing
                    community
                    member. Although he was known to attempt peacemaking, gang violence between Chicago rivalries
                    increased
                    steadily until Capone and his entourage felt the need to avoid Chicago at most times. Because of the
                    violence, Capone moved his family to Miami, Florida, where he purchased a 10,000-square-foot mansion
                    from the Anheuser-Busch family.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>Capone was known for being flashy; having custom suits, expensive jewelry, and imported cigars were
                    all
                    trademarks of the Outfit boss. Capone was also well known for evading any charges during this time,
                    as
                    in every case he was suspected, there was too little evidence to convict him. Even when the police,
                    frustrated, cracked down on Capone’s brothels and gambling dens, Capone gave himself willingly to
                    the
                    department. There was no evidence for any crimes that Chicago police could hold him on, thus setting
                    Capone and his properties free. </p>
                <h5>Saint Valentine’s Day Massacrey</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Al Capone saw himself as a peacemaker, but he was also a practical, if not paranoid, leader of the
                    Chicago Outfit. Capone was reportedly worth $100 million in 1927, equal to $1.7 billion today.
                    Capone
                    had lucrative businesses and a lot to lose. He was rivaled only by the North Side Gang, whose
                    leader,
                    Bugs Moran, presented as a thorn in Capone’s side. Moran’s businesses were booming as well as
                    Capone’s,
                    but hijacking illegal booze operations was common on both sides of the aisle. As the story goes,
                    Capone
                    was tired of dealing with the North Side Gang and wanted their businesses for himself. The way to do
                    this was to get rid of Bugs Moran. Capone ordered a hit on Moran. On February 14, 1929, Capone was
                    safely tucked away in Florida while four of his henchmen, dressed as police, brutally murdered seven
                    of
                    Moran’s men. This would come to be known as the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. </p>

                <br>
                <p>The massacre is one of the most notorious in United States history, but Capone may not have committed
                    it.
                    In fact, no one was ever convicted of the crime. Herbert Hoover and the FBI could find no evidence
                    that
                    Capone ordered the hit. The most obvious information that cleared him was that Moran himself was not
                    even killed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, a few years later, a gangster with ties to Capone was found with the two machine guns used
                    in
                    the killings. The gangster, Fred “Killer” Burke, was convicted on a separate charge (killing a
                    police
                    officer in Michigan after the Massacre) and died in prison. This begs the question of why Capone’s
                    associate, who owned weapons used in the St. Valentine’s Day killings, was never convicted of that
                    crime. The simple answer is that the federal government wanted the guilt to hang on Capone, even if
                    they
                    had no evidence to arrest him, which it still does today.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Modern scholars believe that the killings of February 14th, 1929 may have been due to a myriad of
                    things,
                    from Moran himself ordering the hit to real police officers carrying out the attack in retaliation
                    for
                    the murder of a fellow officer’s son. However, in the popular zeitgeist, the St. Valentine’s Day
                    Massacre is tied to Capone, and it characterizes the violence of Prohibition-era Chicago.</p>
                <img class="left2" src="../assets success story/Al Capone3.jpg" alt="3">
                <br>
                <h5>Arrests, Death, & the Legacy of Al Capone</h5>
                <p>Capone was arrested several times, including in May of 1929, when he was arrested and convicted for
                    carrying a concealed handgun in Philadelphia. Capone served nine months in Pennsylvania’s Eastern
                    State
                    Penitentiary for the crime. He was also arrested in Miami for vagrancy, and although he was
                    sentenced to
                    six months, he never served time for the charge. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In 1931, the Federal Government figured out a way to put Capone behind bars for longer than he’d
                    ever
                    served. They had failed to do so several times, although it is likely that Capone committed or
                    instigated several violent crimes. The crime that finally got him, however, was financial. Capone’s
                    reported income did not align with his payment of taxes. His lavish lifestyle was significantly more
                    expensive than his supposed and taxed income. On June 5, 1931, Capone was indicted for 22 counts of
                    federal tax evasion and 5,000 violations of the Volstead Act, the laws regarding Prohibition. His
                    trial
                    was presided over by a particularly harsh judge, who sentenced Capone to 11 years in prison for his
                    crimes rather than take a plea bargain of two and a half years that Capone’s lawyers relied on.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Capone was sent to Atlanta US Penitentiary, where he was first formally diagnosed with syphilis and
                    gonorrhea. He also experienced perforation of his septum and withdrawal symptoms due to cocaine
                    addiction. Capone was moved to Alcatraz in 1934, where he played banjo in the prison band, the Rock
                    Islanders. Capone’s health worsened considerably during his time at Alcatraz, and he spent the last
                    year
                    of his time in prison in the hospital wing. It was in 1938 that prison doctors diagnosed him with
                    syphilis of the brain, which mimics dementia in its effect. His mental capacity, according to
                    doctors,
                    was that of a twelve-year-old during this time. In 1939, Capone was released based on his poor
                    health at
                    his wife’s appeal. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Capone lived the rest of his life with his wife and grandchildren on his Palm Beach estate until his
                    death from heart failure in January of 1947. He was laid to rest in Chicago. The Outfit remained at
                    the
                    center of Chicago’s organized crime syndicate, albeit more underground, as the group took heed of
                    how
                    Capone’s notoriety led to his demise. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Capone is the basis for the classic imaginings of a gangster in American lore. His pin-striped suit
                    and
                    fedora are notorious as constructions of characters based on him. He is the subject of many films,
                    books, shows, and articles. Loose interpretations of every aspect of his character have been the
                    basis
                    for many more mob-related facets of popular culture. In life, he was once considered the most
                    notorious
                    gangster in the country, and in death, he is, without a doubt, America’s most infamous mobster of
                    all
                    time.</p>
