                <p>

                    Bernard Arnault was born to an industrial family in Roubaix, France in 1949, and graduated from
                    France’s
                    prestigious engineering school the École Polytechnique. Once he had his engineering degree in hand,
                    he
                    would begin his professional career as an engineer within the family’s construction business.


                    After working for his father for close to seven years in the family business, Arnault would
                    eventually
                    rise through the ranks to become the chairman of the company. As chairman, he would successfully run
                    the
                    show for his father for a few years, until he moved on to run a holding company known as Financière
                    Agache.

                    The company was having business problems, and Arnault realized the potential that existed in turning
                    around this failing company, partly due to the strength of one of it’s brands; Christian Dior.

                    As such, Arnault seized the opportunity to take on the task of reorganizing the company, and would
                    successfully reinvigorate it, bringing it back to profitably. One of the strategies Bernard Arnault
                    would employ to succeed in the turn around, was to zero in on having the company’s focus be solely
                    on
                    its luxury goods.

                    The cornerstone of his holding company was Christian Dior, which he single handedly brought roaring
                    back
                    to life. Eventually, he would sell off the non-luxury assets of the company, and begin an aggressive
                    acquisition campaign to acquire other luxury brand companies..</p>
                <br>

                <p>Eventually, Arnault would assume control over the leading luxury products group known as LVMH Moët
                    Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Since this acquisition, he has successfully positioned the company as the
                    world’s leading luxury brand..</p>
